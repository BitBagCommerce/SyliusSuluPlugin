# Overview

***

The Sulu-Sylius integration plugin facilitates seamless communication between Sulu CMS and Sylius eCommerce platform through API integration in shop panel.
This plugin streamlines the process of managing content within Sulu CMS while leveraging the powerful eCommerce capabilities of Sylius.
Because the frontend of each store is always personalized, the plugin for the moment does not provide ready-made solutions for the page or blocks.
It only provides an abstraction layer and examples which you should use to create your own pages or blocks

## We are here to help
This **open-source plugin was developed to help the Sylius community**. If you have any additional questions, would like help with installing or configuring the plugin, or need any assistance with your Sylius project - let us know!
